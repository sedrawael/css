    Margin
<br>
<br>
 Margin is the space outside an element's border, creating distance between the element and
 surrounding elements. It does not affect the element's size but pushes it away from other content on
  the page. Margins can be set individually for each side (top, right, bottom, left) or applied uniformly using
 a single value</p>
