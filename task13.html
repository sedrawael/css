This is the written text 
"Learning to code is like solving a puzzle. Each piece, whether it’s
HTML, CSS, or JavaScript connect to build a complete picture. With
consistent practice and curiosity, anyone can create something amazing.
Start small, but dream big, and remember, every expert was once a
beginner."
Coding is not just about writing lines of syntax; it’s about unlocking
creativity and solving real-world problems. By understanding the
building blocks of programming, you gain the power to turn ideas into
reality. Stay persistent, embrace challenges, and celebrate each
milestone as you grow into a confident and capable coder
